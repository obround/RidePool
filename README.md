# RidePool
**No ride? No problem.** Developed during the Hackabyte Spring Hackathon with _**Aaditya Rana**_.

Also on [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/ridepool-2cxnoh), with a video demo.

## Overview
RidePool is a platform designed to ensure that transportation is never a barrier for students attending school events, club meetings, and other activities hosted outside of school hours. It connects users within the same community or school, fostering trust and eliminating any potential awkwardness. Here's how it works:

 1. **Event Posting**: Organizers can post details of their events on the RidePool application.
 2. **Driver Registration**: Students driving to the event can register themselves as willing to give rides.
 3. **Ride Requests**: Students needing a ride can request a driver willing to carpool.
 4. **Matching**: Drivers can review ride requests, considering the distance from their own location to the rider's place.
 5. **Ride Completion**: After the ride, the driver earns credits, which they can later redeem in the in-house gift shop. This system ensures that all students have access to transportation when needed, fostering a stronger sense of community and participation in extracurricular activities.
